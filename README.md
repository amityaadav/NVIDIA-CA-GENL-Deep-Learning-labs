# NVIDIA-Certified Associate - Generative AI LLM - Deep-Learning-labs
These labs are hands-on python labs designed to teach students the fundamentals of Deep Learning by allowing students to build and train very simple Artificial Neural Networks, Transformers and Natural Language Processing


## Lab 1 - Creating and Training a Neural Network on MNIST dataset
This lab is considered the "Hello World" of neural networks.  Before I could follow along and understand what each line of code was doing, I had to spend several hours to understand fundamental concepts associated in this lab:
- Matrices, Scaler vs. Vector vs. Tensor dimensions, y = mx+b (slope intercept) and why it matters in our training
- Python specific topics such as, using PIL for images, argmax, MNIST dataset and why device assignments (CPU vs GPU) can be beneficial when processing tensors
- PyTorch fundamentals: 
- What is an Activation function and the popular types (Sigmoid, ReLU, Tanh, Softmax)
- What are Optimizers and the popular types (Adam, Adagrad, RMSprop, SGD)
- Non-mathematical theory of gradient descent and how it helps model adjust the weight in the optimizers
- What is a Loss function and popular types (Mean Squared Error, RootMSE)


## Lab 2 - Creating a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and understand Data Augmentation
