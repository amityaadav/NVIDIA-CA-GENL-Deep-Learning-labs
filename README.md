# NVIDIA-Certified Associate - Generative AI LLM - Deep-Learning-labs
These labs are hands on python labs designed to teach students the fundamentals of Deep Learning by allowing students to build and train very simple Artificila Neural Networks, Transformers and Natural Language Processing

## Lab 1 - Creating and Training a Neural Network on MNIST dataset
This lab is considered the "Hello World" of neural networks.  It took several hours to catch up on fundamental concepts associated in this lab such as understanding what tensors are and why use them.  

## Lab 2 - Creating a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and understand Data Augmentation
